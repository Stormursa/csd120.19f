        <h1>Welcome to Alison's CSD120 Website!</h1>
        
        <p> 
        My name is Alison Nadjiwon. I was raised on the Cape Croker First Nation. 
        I found my passion in writing and drawing at an early age, 
        this interest still continueing into the present day. 
    I have yet to publish any books yet but hope to in the future. Computer programming has always intersted me so when I was choosing what I wanted to do with my life I stepped into it. I plan to continue working on my shills and find a job within the industry.
        The Idea that I could build my own programs, own games or software is real reason I wanted to learn code. I love creating things and I see programming as just another way to do that.
        </p>
        <p> My other passion is DND or Dungeons and Dragons. The creative element combined with the teamwork skills it develops and just straight up comedy that can come from one singular sessions pulls me back over and over again. I ran my highschool's club for three years and I plan to run another here.

            <h2>My Three Favourite Classes In DnD</h2>
            <ul>
            <li>Cleric, tank and heals means best of both worlds</li>
            <li>Barbarian, means little rp but lots of damage</li>
            <li>Rogue, lots of rp oppritunities plus edgy backstory bonus points</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Haiku</h2>
